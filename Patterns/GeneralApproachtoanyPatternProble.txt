For any pattern problem, always remember 4 guidelines. 
These guidelines can be used to solve any problem :-

1. For Outer loop, count the no. of rows.
2. For Inner loop, count the no of columns and somehow relate them to no. of rows.
3. Print "*" or whatever is to be printed, inside the inner loop.
4. Observe Symmetry (optional -> used in only few pattern problems).
